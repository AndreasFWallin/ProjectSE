# How to work with Git

The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands used by teams around the globe—including ours.

Detailed description for feature branch workflow: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:

1. **Create a branch:** Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually master) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.

2. **Add commits:** Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.
3. **Open a pull request:** Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.
4. **Discuss and review code:** Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.
5. **Merge:** Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.
6. **Deploy:** Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.
